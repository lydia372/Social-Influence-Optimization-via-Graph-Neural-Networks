# 🗳️ Social Influence Optimization via Graph Neural Networks(CNN)

This project models how voter preferences evolve over time in a social network, based on influence from friends who share common hobbies. It simulates voting behavior, tests influencer strategies, and analyzes network influence using spectral graph theory.

## 📌 Overview

The project aims to explore how individual opinions in a social network stabilize through peer influence. It includes:

- Construction of a social graph based on shared hobbies
- Simulation of vote stabilization over multiple days
- Testing of influencer-based intervention strategies
- Identification of the most influential nodes using spectral analysis
